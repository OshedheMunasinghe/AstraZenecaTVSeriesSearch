# TV Series Code Test

Question: <br>
The expected time frame for this home assignment is considered to be around ~5 hours,
please document in the README.md if there were time constraints limiting your work and
what you would’ve done if you’d had more time. Feel free to spend more time on the
assignment if you like to.

**Answers:** <br>
_So,_ I am an Junior App Developer and I have notices that Typscript is not my strongest side which it cause a lot of
time. But I have gained some knowledge in short time! <br>
I was questionable if I should code with React.FC or without. I have heard so many companies that they are not focusing React.FC but what I have heard from React-native expert that "you should" go with FC.

Therefor I don't know so much all hooks. I know mostly useState, useEffect.

I had no chance to implement searchbar from json.

For somehow I couldn't call some entities from json to add title, description on cards only images I could call.

I was about to use **InfoNetwork**, I think it is the right library to call to check if network is offline, weak, crash ect. 

But unfortunately, I couldn't handle the time.

I haven't got a chance to learn Testing Debugging in school so I have no knowledge of how to debug the app! But I really want to learn.

**Lessons learned:**

* Fix the "skeleton" by meaning; <br>
make sure that Axios is properly working where I can store every data such as Images, Names, title ect.
* Make sure that I can use InfoNetwork to check if the data is slow or crash
* There after make fancy design on components and make it dynamically. 

**How to use the app:** <br>
There is bottom navigation Home and Detail Screen. <br>
Home is where searchbar lives where user can enter some info, unfortunately it doesnt work due to the time. <br>
Detail Screen where you can see all cards of TV-shows.
